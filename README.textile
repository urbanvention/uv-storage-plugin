= urbanvention Storage

Uv::Storage implements a wrapper to the urbanvention storage cloud. This is a half-private cloud that allows
applications to store any type of asset in the cloud and retrieve them when needed. The Uv::Storage cloud is
build to provide high-performance read operations. If a file is ACL public-read best read-performance is provided,
because the request will directly hit the hard-drive and will not go through a processing-application.

Additionally Uv::Storage allows communication between the cloud and the application trough an injected controller, 
if one of our nodes goes down the application will be informed and the urls of the files will be changed 
accordingly. Each file is registered in a special table within the application which saves the relation between a 
file and a database record. This improves perfomance, because no look-ups are needed to get the file's location.

The Uv::Storage module implements basic logic and requirements. More specific information can be found in the 
+Uv::Storage::File+ class. 

== Install

You can wether install Uv::Storage as a plugin or as a submodule into your rails app.

Install as a Plugin:

  script/plugin install git@dev.urbanvention.com/uv_storage_plugin.git

Install as a submodule:

  git submodule add git@dev.urbanvention.com/uv_storage_plugin.git vendor/plugins/uv_storage_plugin

If you install the plugin as a submodule you will need to initialize your submodules upon each installation of the
plugin.

  git submodule init
  git submodule update

== Updating

To update the plugin you have to either remove the whole folder and re-install the plugin or if you installed it as a
git submodule you can go into the directory of the plugin and update the plugin:

  git checkout master       # switch to the master branch of the plugin
  git pull origin master    # pull the latest state from the remote server

== Setup

Run the generate command to generate needed files.

  script/generate uv_storage

This will create the following files for you

* config/uv_storage.yml
* db/102132232_create_file_mapping_table.rb

After the files are created you should run 

  rake db:migrate

To create the needed database tables for Uv::Storage. Also provide your access_key and secrect_key in the 
config/uv_storage.yml file. 

After you finsihed setting up the basic requirements you need to install a few gems that are needed run Uv::Storage,
you can add them to your config/environment.rb. 

  config.gem 'httpclient'
